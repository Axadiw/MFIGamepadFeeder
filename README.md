# MFI Gamepad Feeder

Have you ever wanted to use your MFI (Made for iPhone/iPad) game controller under Windows? With *MFI Gamepad Feeder* it's possible!

## How it works?

*MFI Gamepad Feeder* is a special program that works in tandem with [vGen](https://github.com/shauleiz/vGen) and [ScpVBus](https://github.com/shauleiz/ScpVBus) that creates virtual Xbox 360 controller device in your system.

It looks like modern MFI game controllers are recognized as standard HID gamepads under Windows, but they're not visible in "USB Game Controllers", so games won't be able to use them. *MFI Gamepad Feeder* is connecting to these "HID gamepads", and it's redirecting raw input from them, directly to the ScpVBus devices.

## Requirements

Current version of *MFI Gamepad Feeder* requires

* latest [Xbox 360 drivers](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/pl-pl/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows) first (Windows 7 Only).
* supported MFI Gamepad (list of supported gamepads listed below)

Application was tested on Windows 10, but it should work on older systems as well.

## Installation

1. Download and install [MFI Gamepad Feeder](https://github.com/Axadiw/MFIGamepadFeeder/releases/latest "MFI Gamepad Feeder") (restart required)

2. Plug in your controllers (check compatibility list). If necessary you may need to pair them via Bluetooth.
2. Launch *MFI Gamepad Feeder* application and select:
3. Click "Active" checkbox on the right next to the first row
4. Select your gamepad from "Gamepad device" list. In my case (SteelSeries Nimbus gamepad), gamepad wasn't advertising itself with correct Product name / Manufacturer Name, so I've had to guess which one it was
5. Select ID of your controller (1-4)
6. Select mapping file (All configuration files are stored in the "Configs" folder in the application folder)
7. Hit Start button
8. Play your favorite games!

## Mappings editor

In order to support different types of MFI controllers you can use included mappings editor.

### HID -> XBox 360 translation

In order to create good gamepad mapping you need to understand how **MFIGamepadFeeder** is transforming HID controllers to XBox 360 ones.

Every time you press a button / touch analog stick on you controller, your PC is receiving a small set of numbers that are describing current state of the device.

For example *SteelSeries Nimbus* is sending 18 numbers, each one is responsible for different button / axis. In order to translate these numbers, so **MFIGamepadFeeder** would be able to understand them, you need to specify meaning of each of them.

### Editor
![](mfi_images/Mappings%20editor.PNG)

In order to create a new mapping:

1. Select correct HID device in the "General mapping" tab. This will allow you to see preview of all the data that is coming form the controller.
2. Hit *New* button in the right top corner of the screen.
3. Create as many mapping items as necessary using "Add new item" button at the bottom
4. Specify type of each item:
	* Button (for all buttons on the controller)
	* DPad
	* Axis (for analog sticks and triggers)
	* Empty (for unused parameters)
5. For each item select what XBox controller role it would acquire (accordingly to the previously selected type)
6. Hit Save button


### Virtual keys

Because it isn't physically impossible to emulate all Xbox 360 buttons, even on extended MFI controllers (for example there is only "Menu" button on MFI, whilst there is "Back" and "Start" on X360), only way to use them all is using "virtual keys".

*Virtual Keys* are allowing you to translate even complicated button combinations to different button presses.

You can access *Virtual Keys* from the second tab in the *Mapping Editor*. Manual for this part of the editor is rather straightforward.

For example this configuration:

![](mfi_images/Mappings%20editor_virtual%20keys.PNG)

will result in:

Pressing **RBumper**, **LBumper** and **Start** together will be changed to **Back** button.

**LBumper** + **Start** will end up with **LeftStick** press, whilst **RBumper** + **Start** will be **RightStick** press.

# Supported gamepads

* SteelSeries Nimbus (only via Bluetooth)

### Not compatibile:

* Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L i

Keep in mind that all controllers without **HID** interface won't be compatible with *MFIGamepadFeeder*.

# Connecting gamepads via Bluetooth
In order to connect your gamepad via bluetooth you need to:

1. Turn on your gamepad (and press bluetooth pairing button)
2. Select the Start menu, then select Settings > Devices > Other devices.
3. Turn on Bluetooth > select the device > Ready to pair.
4. Follow any more instructions if they appear.
